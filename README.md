# Description
A wrapper for a minecraft server executable allowing you to control the server and interface with the console in real time through the use of SocketIO. Just a small program I made to learn the technologies and for use with my frontend project.

**Installing/Using**    
- npm install
- Place source files in a directory with a minecraft server JAR. 

*eula.txt is provided to automatically accept the EULA (which you do by downloading the JAR) and eliminate the need to manually accept after it stops the server.
